# prioritized-learning-tree
A generalized logic tree that reflects how humans learn to implement into machine learning.


The logic of learning. I remember in first grade how I came to read my first word out loud. At. The word at was the first world I ever read out loud.
First I was told to memorize the alphabet and their corresponding sounds.
Aa.. ah
Bb.. bey
Cc.. cey
..
Zz.. zeh
 
Once memorized I had to be presented with a problem. A problem with which I understood what was requested of me but
But didn't know how to connect the different pieces of memory. 

At. A word as simple as at, once understood that one must systematically start from left to right and initate the sounds corresponding with that letter can unlock the logic to read any word.

For machine learning, maybe we have started with the wrong logic. For machines to truly be independent thinkers we must program a machine to identify the problem. 

Problem.
